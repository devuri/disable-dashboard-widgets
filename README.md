### Disable Dashboard Widgets
Easily Remove All Widgets from Dashboard for all users except the Administrator.

### Description
The Disable Dashboard Widgets plugin is designed to provide WordPress site administrators with greater control over the dashboard widgets. Once installed and activated, the plugin provides the option to disable dashboard widgets for specific user roles, such as subscribers, editors, and contributors. This means that users in these roles will not be able to see or access any dashboard widgets.

However, it is important to note that the plugin does not restrict access to dashboard widgets for administrators, who will still be able to see all the widgets. The plugin can be particularly useful for sites that have a large number of users with different roles and responsibilities, as it allows site administrators to streamline the dashboard experience for users who do not require access to all the widgets.

Overall, the Disable Dashboard Widgets plugin is a useful tool for site administrators who want to simplify the dashboard experience for their users. It is easy to install and configure, and provides a straightforward solution to the problem of excessive dashboard clutter. Whether you are managing a small site with a few users, or a large site with dozens of contributors, this plugin can help you to optimize the dashboard experience for everyone involved.
